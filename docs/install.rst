Set up of Toolchain for Windows
*******************************

Step 1: Quick Steps
===================

Windows doesn't have a built-in "make" environment, so as well as installing the toolchain you will need a GNU-compatible environment. We use the MSYS2_ environment to provide.
 You don't need to use this environment all the time (you can use Eclipse_ or some other front-end), but it runs behind the scenes.
